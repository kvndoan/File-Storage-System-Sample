# File-Storage-System-Sample
Code snippets for my Dropbox-Inspired Secure File Storage System.

I have attached the basic user creation function for my File Storage System project. Note that I am unable to post the entirity of the code because it contains information that is sensitive to existing/current coursework at UC Berkeley. Aside from some imported helper functions provided by the school, all code is my own and I can share the entire project privately if needed.
